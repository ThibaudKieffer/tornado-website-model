This website model was programmed with python and the web framework tornado 4.1

It's juste an example of website build with tornado, you can modify it if you want.

For the dropdown menu it use superfish: http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/
For the design it use Foundation 5: http://foundation.zurb.com/

I create it with Debian wheezy and necessary packets are :

- Python version is 2.7 : sudo apt-get install python.
- Pip (Download and install it with instructions at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).
- Tornado (install it with : sudo pip install tornado).
- Email (install it with : sudo pip install email).

Launch the website with : python main.py in the good folder.

Create a mandrill account at http://mandrill.com/ or use an other SMTP service.
Modify main.py and add your mandrill account and API KEY for SMTP automatic mail service.
